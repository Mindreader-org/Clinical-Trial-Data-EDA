Introduction
ClinicalTrials.gov REST API
Resources
Notice to API users:
ClinicalTrials.gov has a modernized data ingest as of August 26, 2025. Two major groups of data are impacted.

Some "markup" fields, which contain rich formatted text in the legacy "chintzy" format (a subset of HTML formatting), do not have the exact format of the classic data pipeline.
Locations and geopoint data are now pulling from a different database for geographic data.
To learn more about the Modernized ClinicalTrials.gov API, please visit About the API, which includes a Migration Guide, descriptions of the Search Areas, and more.

Introduction
The CTG API specification is available in YAML format and can be used with a variety of tools and other software frameworks to generate client code for interacting with the REST API in a way that is specific for the target language or environment.

The OpenAPI 3.0 Specification is an open-source format for describing and documenting HTTP APIs. An OpenAPI 3.0 specification serves as the core definition for the API of the ClinicalTrials.gov website.

Schedule of data updates
Data on ClinicalTrials.gov is refreshed daily Monday through Friday, generally by 9 a.m. ET (14:00 UTC). However, to ensure your API requests gather the most recent data, please check the “dataTimestamp” field available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/version to ensure the refresh has completed.

ClinicalTrials.gov REST API
This API is made available to provide users meta data, statistics, and the most recent version of the clinical trials available on ClinicalTrials.gov.

get

Studies
Studies
Returns data of studies matching query and filter parameters. The studies are returned page by page. If response contains nextPageToken, use its value in pageToken to get next page. The last page will not contain nextPageToken. A page may have empty studies array. Request for each subsequent page must have the same parameters as for the first page, except countTotal, pageSize, and pageToken parameters.

If neither queries nor filters are set, all studies will be returned. If any query parameter contains only NCT IDs (comma- and/or space-separated), filters are ignored.

query.* parameters are in Essie expression syntax. Those parameters affect ranking of studies, if sorted by relevance. See sort parameter for details.

filter.* and postFilter.* parameters have same effect as there is no aggregation calculation. Both are available just to simplify applying parameters from search request. Both do not affect ranking of studies.

Note: When trying JSON format in your browser, do not set too large pageSize parameter, if fields is unlimited. That may return too much data for the browser to parse and render.

Min 1 item
If specified, must be non-empty comma- or pipe-separated list of fields to return. If unspecified, all fields will be returned. Order of the fields does not matter.

For csv format, specify list of columns. The column names are available on CSV Download.

For json format, every list item is either area name, piece name, field name, or special name. If a piece or a field is a branch node, all descendant fields will be included. All area names are available on Search Areas, the piece and field names — on Data Structure and also can be retrieved at /studies/metadata endpoint. There is a special name, @query, which expands to all fields queried by search.

Examples: [ NCTId, BriefTitle, OverallStatus, HasResults ] ┃ [ ProtocolSection ]
sort
array of string
add-multiple ↩
Max 2 items
Comma- or pipe-separated list of sorting options of the studies. The returning studies are not sorted by default for a performance reason. Every list item contains a field/piece name and an optional sort direction (asc for ascending or desc for descending) after colon character.

All piece and field names can be found on Data Structure and also can be retrieved at /studies/metadata endpoint. Currently, only date and numeric fields are allowed for sorting. There is a special "field" @relevance to sort by relevance to a search query.

Studies missing sort field are always last. Default sort direction:

Date field - desc
Numeric field - asc
@relevance - desc
Examples: [ @relevance ] ┃ [ LastUpdatePostDate ] ┃ [ EnrollmentCount:desc, NumArmGroups ]
countTotal
boolean
Default: false
Count total number of studies in all pages and return totalCount field with first page, if true. For CSV, the result can be found in x-total-count response header. The parameter is ignored for the subsequent pages.

pageSize
int32
Default: 10
Min 0
Page size is maximum number of studies to return in response. It does not have to be the same for every page. If not specified or set to 0, the default value will be used. It will be coerced down to 1,000, if greater than that.

Examples: 2 ┃ 100
pageToken
string
Token to get next page. Set it to a nextPageToken value returned with the previous page in JSON format. For CSV, it can be found in x-next-page-token response header. Do not specify it for first page.
